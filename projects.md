## Wait Wait Stats

### Wait Wait Stats Page

I have collected scoring data, panelist and guest appearances across the history of the NPR weekly news quiz show, "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!", and publish a record of each show and provide panelist statistics as part of the Stats Page.

The site is written in Python and built using Flask.

### Wait Wait Stats API

As I received more requests for data from the Wait Wait Stats database, I created an API that allows people to query collected data about the show's guests, hosts, locations, panelists, scorekeepers and related data. The API is written in Python and built using FastAPI.

### Wait Wait Reports

The Wait Wait Reports site provides detailed reports and search features that provide information that goes beyond what is available on the Wait Wait Stats Page. The site is written in Python and built using Flask.

### Wait Wait Graphs

The Wait Wait Graphs site has interactive charts that present information ranging from panelist scoring and appearances to Bluff the Listener statistics. The site is written in Python and built using Flask and Plotly.js.

## Marsupial Gurgle

I have been collecting, editing and archiving audio clips from the daily podcast "[TBTL: Too Beautiful to Live](https://tbtl.net/)". The site is named after an audio phenomenon that happened on an episode of the podcast from 2014.

## Photography

Over the years, I have spent a fair amount of time behind the camera, taking photos at track days and other club events for the local chapter of the Audi Club, local car meets and events, and TBTL live events. I have also taken photos in and around Portland, Oregon; as well as, photos for previous social media ventures.

I have shot with various Nikon (D300, D500, D800E), Leica (M6 TTL and M9) and Sony (RX100) cameras.
