Try and Coury from [My Life in Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@mylifeingaming) recently published a video discussing their thoughts about and ranking [video game console designs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu0a9LG8XT4). As part of the creation of the video, they created a [tier list template](https://tiermaker.com/create/video-game-console-design-rankings-17681910-2) on TierMaker for anyone to use to create their own tier list.

I thought it would be fun to create my own tier list based on the consoles that I have owned or currently own, or have spent a good amount of time playing on. I have also excluded any emulated-specific consoles, including various MiSTer FPGA, Anbernic or Raspberry Pi-based devices that I have owned.

One change hat I made to my tier list is to use the more traditional letter tier names rather than the more *expressive* names that they used.

## Defining Each Tier

Before I could rank each video game console, I needed to define qualities I am looking for, what designs or features make or break a console, and what issues can cause a console to lose points.

The tiers listed will be in worst to best order, going from F through S.

**F Tier**
: Consoles that suffer from extremely poor design choices or ergonomics.
: Major flaws and issues that can render the console to be rendered unusable.

**D Tier**
: Consoles that have bad design choices or ergonomics that get in the way of being able to enjoy playing games on the console.
: The console design feels uninspired, cheap, or underwhelmed given the original price of the console
: There may be other problems that are not breaking.

**C Tier**
: Consoles that have designs that are a little too middle-of-the-road, or designs that went a little bit too far or ahead of its time.
: Some ergonomics issues (including controllers).
: Quality of the hardware matches expectation given original price of the console.

**B Tier**
: Consoles that have inspired designs, ergonomics and stand out from the crowd (in a subjectively good way).
: Minimal ergonomics issues.
: Provides a great bang for the buck.

**A Tier**
: Exceptional and timeless design, ergonomics and features.
: Went well beyond the initial expectations set by the original build up

## F Tier

### Mattel Intellivision

The original Intellivision was my first video game console that I got as a hand-me-down. While I did have fun playing Astrosmash and the port of Donkey Kong, the controllers were horrible. Many games had easy to lose inlays that cover the number pad to designate which button does what, I can still feel the pain of continual pressing of the number pad buttons, and the controller's side buttons were mediocre.

On top of that, the controllers are attached to the console using coiled cables that can be more trouble than its worth. The console is also quite wide at around 16 inches (40.6 cm) and requires extra space in order to insert and remove cartridges from the side mounted slot.

### NEC TurboGrafx-16

When compared to the compact PC Engine sold in Japan, the NEC TurboGrafx-16 takes up a lot more space than it should. As with the Intellivision, the TurboGrafx-16 is pretty wide at a little over 11 inches (28 cm) and all expansion is done through the rear expansion slot.

Speaking of expansion, the thick CD-ROM² expansion unit, called the TurboGrafx-CD in the United States, juts out of the back and sticks out like a sore thumb. If you had the system placed inside of an entertainment cabinet, reaching back to insert or remove a CD was not fun. For better video output compared to the integrated RF output, an optional TurboBooster-Plus module mounted to the back of the console is required.

The console only had one controller port in the front and required a TurboTap expansion unit to attach one to three additional controllers. I would have thought that they could have included a second controller port given the much larger size compared to the PC Engine.

Most of the shortcomings of the TurboGrafx-16 were solved when the TurboDuo was released. The integrated CD-ROM² drive is located to the right of the card slot and the console includes composite video output. Unfortunately, it was too little, too late, and a little too expensive.

I always wanted the sleek TurboDuo and preferred the sleek design compared to the somewhat bulgy PC Engine Duo R. It may also be one of the only times I prefer the version sold in North America over the version sold in Japan.

### Ouya

The less that can be said about the Ouya overall, the better. The console and the controller felt (and were) extremely cheaply made, the console experience was really poor, and the extremely hit-or-miss quality of games. I only used my console for a couple of days before boxing it back up and stowing it away.

### Microsoft XBOX 360

Red Ring of Death. That alone should be enough to put the XBOX 360 on the very bottom tier for most people's video game console tier list. Although the launch edition XBOX 360 that I have hasn't experienced the Red Ring of Death, but it also didn't get that much use compared to the other consoles that I had at that time.

The sleek design of the XBOX 360 meant that there was not enough room for adequate cooling or for an internal power supply. Between the loud cooling fans, the loud DVD-ROM drive, and the large and cumbersome external power supply did not help things out either.

There was also the issue of the proprietary hard drive module compared to the standard SATA drive used by the Sony PlayStation 3, lack of HDMI output on the launch models (though slightly negated by way of component or VGA cables), and storage limitations imposed by using DVD-ROM media for game distribution.

Even though I had a PlayStation 3 to watch Blu-Ray discs, I picked up the HD-DVD expansion for the XBOX 360 along with a couple of the free HD-DVD discs. Before I unplugged and packed away the XBOX 360, I think I used it to watch those discs more than I used it for playing games.

## D Tier

### Microsoft XBOX Series X

Unlike the XBOX 360's sleek design that compromised on cooling and noise, the XBOX Series X's black monolith design is just rather uninspiring and forgettable. The console looks the best when stood upright, but it requires too much vertical space to allow the console to spit out the heat at the top. When sat on its side, it is still too thick and long compared to the other consoles on this tier list.

As with the XBOX 360, Microsoft decided to go with a proprietary storage expansion option with relatively expensive cards, especially at launch. In comparison, the Sony PlayStation 5 has a standard M.2 NVMe slot (though it wasn't usable at launch) that could use any drives that met the performance requirements.

Another issue that I have with the XBOX Series X is wireless connectivity with the controller is flaky during use, it doesn't always wake up the console from sleep, and it drains batteries way too quickly. I tried using the official rechargable battery pack, but it was inconsistent and had it's own flakiness.

Lastly, even though the console is capable of 4K output and has a Blu-Ray drive, it isn't capable of 4K Ultra HD playback. Even as a standard Blu-Ray player, the console isn't very quiet and draws too much power compared to a standalone 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray player.

### Analogue Super Nt and Mega Sg

From the technical standpoint, the Analogue Super Nt and Mega Sg FPGA-based consoles are darn near perfect, but only when using "jail-broken" firmware to enable features that should have been included from the beginning (including: backing up saves and data from cartridges).

In terms of design, I get the visual nods that they made to evoke nostalgia of the original Super Famicom/Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. But, the rest of the design is pretty dull. I also dislike the placement of the SD card slot that is used to upgrade the device's firmware (or store backed up cartridge files to play games sans cartridge with the jail-broken firmware).

### Nintendo New 2DS XL
