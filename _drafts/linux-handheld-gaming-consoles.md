# Linux Handheld Gaming Consoles

In my previous post, I briefly mentioned my collection of handheld gaming consoles, each running custom builds of Linux, EmulationStation, and RetroArch. Now, I want to share my personal thoughts and experiences with these consoles, diving deeper into their unique features and functionalities.

I'll cover the Anbernic RG351MP, RG552, and RG35XX H consoles and a RetroFlag GPi Case 2. Although the original and OLED Steam Decks are handhelds that run Linux, EmulationStation, and RetroArch, I'll save them for future posts.

## Anbernic RG351MP and RG35XX H

Both the RG351MP and RG35XX H share several things in common, including a 3.5-inch IPS display with a resolution of 640x480, a horizontal Game Boy Advance form factor, two TF/microSD card slots, and nearly identical control layouts. However, they also have a couple of key differences.

The RG351MP is related to the family of RG351 handhelds, which include the RG351P, RG351M, and RG351V. All four handhelds include a Rockchip RK3326 processor with four ARM Cortex-A35 cores but differ in either screen aspect ratio (the RG351M and RG351P have a 3:2 aspect ratio with a resolution of 480x320) or in form factor (the RG351V has an original Nintendo Game Boy vertical design with the RG351MP's 4:3 aspect ratio display).

Another distinguishing feature of the RG351MP (and the RG351M) is the aluminum shell, while the RG351P and RG351V have plastic shells. I used to have an RG351V but switched to the RG351MP as I preferred the latter's ergonomics, size, and form factor.

The RG35XX H is related to the RG35XX Plus and a new version of the RG35XX, which shares the same Allwinner H700 processor with four ARM Cortex-A53 cores.

I use AmberELEC (formerly 351ELEC) on the RG351MP and a custom version of Batocera Linux on the RG35XX H for the operating system. After using
