## About Me

My name is Linh Pham and I am a TechOps/Release Manager with a background in IT Systems Engineering, with a focus on compute, storage and virtualization. I am also the unofficial scorekeeper of [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org), and the creator and maintainer of the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me).

In addition, I have created and maintained an audio clip archive for the [TBTL: Too Beautiful to Live](https://tbtl.net) podcast called [Marsupial Gurgle](https://marsupialgurgle.com).

## Work

I have worked as an IT Systems Administrator and Systems Engineer with a focus on compute, storage, virtualization, and public and private cloud infrastructure. More recently, I have transitioned to being a DevOps/TechOps Engineer and have taken on the role of being a Release Manager.

Over the years, I have worked to support and manage systems running Windows, Linux (primarily Debian-based distributions), macOS and FreeBSD. I have also managed and developed applications for Solaris and AIX. The majority of the development work has been in the realm of automation, data and log processing and building supporting tools for Jenkins and Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines.

## Programming

My language of preference and the one that I am most well-versed in is Python. In addition, I have built applications and tools in C#, PHP and a little bit of JavaScript. Languages that I would like to learn include: Swift, Go, and Rust.

## Hobbies

Outside of work and working on the various Wait Wait Stats-related projects, I have dabbled in some [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums) and play video games from the 8-bit and 16-bit console era, especially those from Nintendo and Sega.
