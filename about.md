## About Me

Hello. My name is Linh Pham (he/him/they/them). I am a Software Release Manager with a background in IT Systems Engineering, where I previously focused on servers, storage, and virtualization. I am also the unofficial scorekeeper of [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org), and the creator and maintainer of the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me).

In addition, I have created and maintained an audio clip archive for the [TBTL: Too Beautiful to Live](https://tbtl.net) podcast called [Marsupial Gurgle](https://marsupialgurgle.com).

## Work

I am a Software Release Manager. I support releases for product and development teams. This includes creating and documenting processes and validating that teams meet the change control requirements set out by Change Management.

Before becoming a Software Release Manager, I worked as a DevOps/TechOps engineer, helping teams create and use continuous development/deployment workflows and pipelines in Jenkins, Concourse, and Azure DevOps.

I also worked as an IT Systems Administrator and Systems Engineer managing servers, networked and shared storage, virtualization, and public and private cloud infrastructure.

Over the years, I have worked to support and manage systems running Windows, Linux (primarily Debian-based distributions), macOS, and FreeBSD. I have also managed and developed applications for Solaris and AIX. Most of the development work has been in automation, data and log processing, and building support tools for developers and customer support teams.

## Programming

My language of preference, and the one I am most well-versed, is Python. In addition, I have built applications and tools in C#, PHP, and a bit of JavaScript. I want to learn languages like Swift, Go, and Rust.

## Hobbies

Outside of work and working on the various Wait Wait Stats-related projects, I have dabbled in some [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums) and play video games from the 8-bit and 16-bit console era, especially those from Nintendo and Sega.
