## Intro

My name is Linh Pham and I am an IT/DevOps Engineer and I collect data and information from NPR's "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!" weekly news quiz show for the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me).

## Work

I have worked in both IT and Dev worlds. On the IT side, I have designed and managed compute, storage, virtualization, and public and private cloud infrastructure. In the past few years, I've moved over to the development side as a DevOps Engineer and a Release Manager; where, I build and manage CI/CD pipelines for automated application configuration and deployment. I also help teams with adhering to regulatory and process requirements.

The operating systems that I currently work with include Windows, Linux (primarily Debian-based distributions), macOS and FreeBSD. I have also managed and developed applications for Solaris and AIX.

## Coding

When I do have a chance to do some development, Python is my language of choice. I have also developed and maintained code written in C# and PHP. Swift and Go are on my list of languages that I would love to learn.
