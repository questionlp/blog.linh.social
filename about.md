## About Me

My name is Linh Pham and I am an Software Release Engineer, with a background in IT and DevOps, and I am the nerd that created and currently maintains the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/).

In addition, I created and maintain an audio clip archive for the [TBTL: Too Beautiful to Live](https://tbtl.net/) podcast called [Marsupial Gurgle](https://marsupialgurgle.com/).

## Work

Currently, I am a software release engineer for a large software and services company, where I help teams navigate through various change control and regulatory requirements to release new versions of their software. I also work on creating documentation and standards related to release processes and workflows.

I have previously worked as a DevOps/TechOps Engineer, working on CI/CD pipelines for automated application configuration and deployment. I have also worked as an IT Systems Engineer, working with bare metal servers, virtualization, monitoring, and managing Windows and Linux servers.

## Coding

When I do have a chance to do some development, Python is my language of choice. I have also developed and maintained code written in C# and PHP. Swift and Go are on my list of languages that I would love to learn.
