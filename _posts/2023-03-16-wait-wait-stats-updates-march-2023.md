With the release of [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) 1.20.0 and a recent update to the [Materialize](https://materializeweb.com/) framework to 1.2.2, I have updated both the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) and [Wait Wait Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me/) to use the updated versions.

The changes have also been published to the respective project repositories on GitHub:

- [graphs.wwdt.me_v2](https://github.com/questionlp/graphs.wwdt.me_v2)
- [stats.wwdt.me_v5](https://github.com/questionlp/stats.wwdt.me_v5)
