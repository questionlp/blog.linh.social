Last Thursday, I traveled to Seattle, Washington, for a taping of [Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org/) at the Paramount Theatre. The Wait Wait team informed me about the show in April and graciously provided me with a pair of tickets.

I made the four-hour trip from Oregon, grabbed some dinner, and went to the theatre. Signs at the entrance and throughout the venue noted that, due to last-minute illness, Peter Sagal would not be the show's host. Instead, Tom Papa was a last-minute fill-in. As I got to my seat, I saw that the panelists for the show would be Jessi Klein, Shantira Jackson, and Luke Burbank.

When they brought on the listener contestant for the "Who's Bill This Time?" segment, there were issues with the phone connection, which led to the folks behind the scenes asking the contestant to hold on while they called them back. After reconnecting with the contestant, the issues did not reoccur.

This was reminiscent of the last time I was in Seattle when issues with the phone lines for the second show meant they selected a couple of audience members as contestants. This was brought up after meeting with Miles, Robert, and Colin after the show, when they jokingly said that it was more than a coincidence that I was there for both issues.

The audience was ecstatic when Tom Papa announced that J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt would be the Not My Job guest, which carried over to the actual segment. Kenji had some assistance from the audience when answering the second and third quiz questions.

Zipping forward to Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank, the audience cheered on Luke after Jessi and Shantira answered seven questions correctly. When it came to Luke's fifth question, the audience backed Luke when he answered the question with "curing his heartburn," while the answer was "to focus on his gut health," leading to Bill giving Luke credit. This helped lead Luke to a win with seven correct answers.

I enjoyed the show, and it was the first time I saw Jessi and Shantira on the panel. I cannot wait for the next time Wait Wait swings back through the Pacific Northwest.
