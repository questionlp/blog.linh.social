This is just a quick addendum to the last post where I mentioned that you can help support the development and maintenance of the [Wait Wait Stats](https://stats.wwdt.me) project by joining my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Linh_Pham). Support tiers now start at 1 USD/month.

You can also sponsor my work through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/questionlp) as a one-time or recurring monthly sponsorship.
